       " Let me tell you now \n
Here we go \n\n
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say \n
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break \n
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space \n
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way (come on)\n\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do (hey)\n\n
Here come bad news talking this and that (yeah)\n
Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back (yeah)\n
Well, I should probably warn you, you'll be just fine (yeah)\n
No offense to you, don't waste your time\n
(Here's why)\n\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do\n\n
Here go\n
(Happy)\n
Bring me down\n
Can't nothing (happy)\n
Bring me down\n
My level's too high (happy)\n
To bring me down\n\n
To bring me\n
(Let me tell you now)\n
Bring me down\n
Can't nothing\n
Bring me down\n
His level's too high\n
To bring me down\n
To bring me down\n\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you\n
Because I'm happy\n
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do\n\n

        "Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep \n
Dreaming about the things that we could be\n
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard\n
Said no more counting dollars\n
We'll be counting stars\n
Yeah, we'll be counting stars\n \n
I see this life, like a swinging vine\n
Swing my heart across the line\n
And in my face is flashing signs\n
Seek it out and ye shall find\n \n
Old, but I'm not that old\n
Young, but I'm not that bold\n
And I don't think the world is sold\n
On just doing what we're told\n \n
I feel something so right\n
Doing the wrong thing\n
And I feel something so wrong\n
Doing the right thing\n
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie\n
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive\n \n
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep\n
Dreaming about the things that we could be\n
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard\n
Said no more counting dollars\n

Said no more counting dollars\n
We'll be, we'll be counting stars\n
Yeah\n \n
I feel your love and I feel it burn\n
Down this river, every turn\n
Hope is our four-letter word\n
Make that money, watch it burn\n \n
Old, but I'm not that old\n
Young, but I'm not that bold\n
And I don't think the world is sold\n
On just doing what we're told\n \n
And I feel something so wrong\n
Doing the right thing\n
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie\n
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly\n \n
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep\n
Dreaming about the things that we could be\n

Dreaming about the things that we could be\n
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard\n
Said no more counting dollars\n
We'll be, we'll be counting stars\n \n
Oh, take that money, watch it burn\n
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned\n
Take that money, watch it burn\n
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned\n
Take that money, watch it burn\n
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned\n
Take that money, watch it burn\n

        "Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (fighter)\n
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting\n
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh\n
And all this time, I've been hiding\n
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah\n
I'm so used to sharing\n
Love only left me alone\n
But I'm at one with the silence\n\n
I found peace in your violence\n
Can't tell me there's no point in trying\n
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long\n
I found peace in your violence\n
Can't tell me there's no point in trying\n
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long\n\n
I've been quiet for too long\n
I've been quiet for too long\n
I found peace in your violence\n
Can't tell me there's no point in trying\n
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long\n\n
I'm in need of a savior (savior), but I'm not asking for favors\n
My whole life, I've felt like a burden\n
I think too much, and I hate it\n
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring\n
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence\n\n
I found peace in your violence\n
Can't tell me there's no point in trying\n
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long\n
I found peace in your violence\n
Can't tell me there's no point in trying\n
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long\n\n
I've been quiet for too long\n
I've been quiet for too long\n
I found peace in your violence\n

There's an endless road to re-discover\n
Hey sister\n
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker\n
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you\n
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do\n\n
Hey brother\n
Do you still believe in one another?\n
Hey sister\n
Do you still believe in love I wonder?\n
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you\n
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do\n\n
What if I'm far from home?\n
Oh, brother I will hear you call\n
What if I lose it all?\n
Oh, sister I will help you out\n

    "Lately, I've been, I've been thinking\n
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier \n\n
When the morning comes\n
When we see what we've become\n
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind\n
Not the fire that we've begun\n
Every argument, every word we can't take back\n
'Cause with the all that has happened\n
I think that we both know the way that this story ends\n\n
Then only for a minute\n
I want to change my mind\n
'Cause this just don't feel right to me\n
I wanna raise your spirits\n
I want to see you smile but\n
Know that means I'll have to leave\n\n
Know that means I'll have to leave\n
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking\n
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n\n
When the evening falls\n
And I'm left there with my thoughts\n
And the image of you being with someone else\n
Well, that's eating me up inside\n
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay\n
Now if we jump together at least we can swim\n
Far away from the wreck we made\n\n
Then only for a minute\n
I want to change my mind\n
'Cause this just don't feel right to me\n
I wanna raise your spirits\n
I want to see you smile but\n
Know that means I'll have to leave\n\n
Know that means I'll have to leave\n
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking\n
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n\n
So I'll go, I'll go\n
I will go, go, go\n
So I'll go, I'll go\n
I will go, go, go\n\n
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking\n
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n
Even though I might not like this\n
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier\n\n
Then only for a minute (only for a minute)
I want to change my mind\n
'Cause this just don't feel right to me\n
I wanna raise your spirits\n
I want to see you smile but\n
Know that means I'll have to leave\n\n
Know that means I'll have to leave\n
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking\n
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n\n
So I'll go, I'll go\n
I will go, go, go\n\n"

    <string name="fireflies_lyrics">

        "You would not believe your eyes\n
If ten million fireflies\n
Lit up the world as I fell asleep\n
'Cause they fill the open air\n
And leave teardrops everywhere\n
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare\n\n
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly\n
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\n
'Cause everything is never as it seems\n\n
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs\n
From ten thousand lightning bugs\n
As they tried to teach me how to dance\n
A foxtrot above my head\n
A sock hop beneath my bed\n
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)\n\n
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly\n
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\n
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)\n\n
Leave my door open just a crack\n
Please take me away from here\n
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac\n
Please take me away from here\n
Why do I tire of counting sheep?\n
Please take me away from here\n
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep\n\n
To ten million fireflies\n
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes\n
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (they said farewell)\n
But I'll know where several are\n
If my dreams get real bizarre\n
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar, jar)\n\n
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly\n
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\n
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)\n\n
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly\n
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\n
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)\n\n"
